# Discord Channel Bridge

This repository is wired for the Discord-to-webhook bridge pattern.

## Topology
- Discord bot process receives messages and forwards to local webhook endpoint.
- Webhook process invokes copilot_responder.py and posts callback responses.
- In shared mode, one central Discord router can serve many repos.

- Webhook port: 8906
- Discord response server port: 9006

## Required Environment

  - DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
  - DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS (optional)
  - RESPONSE_SERVER_PORT
- channels/webhook/.env

## Run

2. Start local Discord bot (optional if central router is used): cd C:/tools/nonprofit_tool/channels/discord && npm start

## Recommended Multi-Repo Mode
- Use central router in C:\tools\discord_router.
- Run one webhook per repo.
